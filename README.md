<h1 align="center">Android IP Rotator TetherControl</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project automates IP rotation for anti-detect browsers using Android smartphones and ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Designed for privacy-focused automation stacks, it toggles airplane mode on/off to fetch a new mobile IP address, then bridges that connection to your desktop via USB tethering. Ideal for users running Reddit, Facebook, or X.com bot farms, this system ensures fresh sessions without needing expensive residential proxies or rooted devices.

Itâ€™s simple, stealthy, and makes your Android phone the core of a mobile proxy rotation setup.


## Core Features:
- **Device-Controlled IP Switching:** Uses native ADB commands to toggle airplane mode without rooting the Android device.
- **Tethered IP Inheritance:** Shares the fresh IP directly with your laptop or VM through USB tethering, perfect for anti-detect browsers.
- **Triggerable via Script:** Can be connected to any bot or browser launch script to sync IP change with automation start.
